# PLC-Lift-Controller
In this exercise, I used PLC to command a lift. My lift has 3 floors and uses FIFO method to receive and execute a command. This PLC controller is still used in many building, companies and installations in order for the lift to be automated. It is simple to understand Ladder diagram and to debug in case of any error.
